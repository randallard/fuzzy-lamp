# Getting set up in IntelliJ Idea

You should have Cursive installed in IntelliJ

Start by setting deps.edn to open in IntelliJ - for example, in Windows file explorer, right click deps.edn and choose 'open with' then 'choose another application'.  
Check the box next to "Always use this app to open .edn files" and select IntelliJ Idea 

Open IntelliJ Idea by double clicking deps.edn

Find and click the Terminal tab at the bottom of IntelliJ Idea
cd to your repo, probably fulcro-developers-guide-start
run shadow-cljs install with the following command

    npm install shadow-cljs react react-dom --save

run in the terminal

    npx shadow-cljs server

in a browser, go to the localhost:9### listed (where :9### is maybe :9630)

click 'Builds' in the top tabs list

click on the word 'main' so you can see the updates as it compiles, text in a box labeled 'Status' will appear

click 'Watch'
wait for green

in a new tab, go to http://localhost:8000

Should see "Ready to go!"

If you have trouble with the following steps - refer to the instructions at: https://cursive-ide.com/userguide/deps.html

in IntelliJ

Edit Configurations

add (+) Clojure REPL - Remote

set the following

name: cljs repl

connection type:  nREPL

connection details:

connect to server
- host: localhost
- port: 9000

click 'apply' then 'ok'

Choose 'cljs repl'

click the green play button next to it

click in the repl where you see "Connecting to remote nREPL..."

let's run some clojure in the repl - enter the following 

    (+ 1 1)

submit with ctrl+enter

hopefully you see => 2 show up in the REPL

to connect to the app running in the browser, run

    (shadow/repl :main)

now you can run

    (js/alert "howdy")

go to your localhost:8000 tab and you should see the alert "howdy"

click ok on that

open dev tools there in chrome and go to the console

back in the repl, run

    (print "up and running!")

in the console of the browser you should see "up and running!"
